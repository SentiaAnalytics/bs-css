#### Breaking changes

This version of bs-css is using a new runtime library that replaces glamor.
 
This decision is driven by the following points:

- the author of glamor is no more maintaining its project, the last commit happened more than one year ago,
- emotion is the recommended alternative because it mostly matches glamor's API
- better grid support : glamor uses a lot of the old -ms-grid and -webkit-grid prefixes (with IE11 support)
- Merging styles with sub selectors work as expected and fix a bug bs-css had

Given that it is a major version, we also changed some functions in the API, especially regarding merging.

#### Migration

- `fontWeight` number must now use the `num` constructor: you must change `fontWeight(300)` to `fontWeight(num(300))`.
The benefit is that you can transform your absolute numbers to font names, see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight#Common_weight_name_mapping. 
- `merge` was really a `concat` function and could lead to problems as seen in #86. This is why it has been changed to use 
the internal library (emotion) and its signature is now : `list(string) => string`. If you want to keep the same functionality
than before, you can use `List.concat` instead or `@` operator.
- if you are mixin reason/js, you need to change your dependency and replace `glamor` with `emotion`
- `flexGrow` accepts a float instead of an int, add a `.` to your int value (for ex, convert `1` to `1.`)
